# Output Feedback Bilateral Teleoperation with Force Estimation (Paper Implementation)

Final project (paper implementation) for the Physical Human Robot Interaction course @ UNIVR.

The main goal of this project is to implement a UR5 simulation environment for the teleoperation system proposed by [Daly et al.](https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2013.2242329). Many of the details omitted in the brief can be found in the original [PhD thesis](http://hdl.handle.net/10012/5115).
